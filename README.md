# Desktop-Notification-App
 
I have created a Desktop Notification App using Python programming Language. I have used Plyer (a Python library) for creating a app that sends out notifications on your system every 20 mins to stop working and move your eyes :eyes: away from the screen so that you can give rest to your eyes. Gazing away from the screen this way lets your eye muscles release, decreasing your chance of eye strain :relieved: . 

So this a helpful app that will always remind you incase you are more indulged in binge-watching your favorite Netflix shows :smiley:!
